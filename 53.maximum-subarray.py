# Testcase Example:  '[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]'
#
# Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at
# least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using
# the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
